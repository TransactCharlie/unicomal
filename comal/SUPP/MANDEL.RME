THE MANDELBROT SET CALCULATING PROGRAM

The MANDEL.CML program calculates and displays subsets of the
Mandelbrot set. Here is a program that allows you to explore the
beauty of this purely mathematical set, showing an enormous
complexity created out from a very simple mathematical formula.
It is easy to become fascinated during the exploration of the
set. A lot of magazine articles and books that have been
published about this subject proves it.

This program requires a PC with at least 512 KB of RAM memory and
a CGA, EGA, or VGA graphic adapter. Optionally, the PC can be
equipped with a math coprocessor to enhance speed of
calculations.

To run the program, simply type from DOS:

     comal mandel        -- Run MANDEL.CML using software math
or
     comal87 mandel      -- Run MANDEL.CML using math coprocessor

You can also run it from the interactive UniComal system.

The program controls a file, MANxx.MAN, with information about
each picture you create while using the program. If you leave the
program with Quit, all information is saved to disk in the
current directory. When you start the program again, it continues
where you left, remembering all the pictures created.

Note: because of the lenghty calculation times, you have the
possibility to save to disk the picture you have drawn by typing
S. This picture will be read from disk when you want to see it in
stead of being recalculated. It is a lot faster to load a picture
than to regenerate it. Be aware that pictures saved to disk take
up a lot of room. The picture files are named MANxxx.PIC.

HOW TO USE THE MANDELBROT PROGRAM

When the program starts, it shows a screen with a column in the
side describing what you can do and the status of program. Most
of the screen is set aside to the picture of a part of the
mandelbrot set.

The left side of the screen is divided in the fields described
below.

X^2+P     This is the mathematical formula used for the calcu-
          lations. It is expressed in complex arithmetic. It is a
          short form of  X(i+1) = X(i)^2+P, i.e. the next X is
          calculated from current X squared and then added P. P
          is the point on the screen we want to find a colour
          for. The colour is determined from how many times it is
          necessary to iterate the above mentioned formula before
          X exceeds a certain value. Each iteration is assigned a
          particular colour from a set as shown in the Colour
          Model (see point C below).


          This program is able to produce pictures based on other
          formulas than X^2+P. By pressing the X-key, you can
          select the next formula. Five formulas are available:

            X^2+P        The most famous mandelbrot set.
            X^3+P        A variation.
            X^4+P        One more variation.
            P*X*(1-X)    Interesting.
            1/(X^2+P)    The last variation.

          You can as mentioned choose a formula by typing X.

Quality:  This text labels that the three text below (Rough,
          Medium, and High) relates to the quality of the
          calculation granularity. Because of the enormous amount
          of calculations required to generate a picture, three
          levels of detail are available, giving you the chance
          to select interesting parts in rough detail before you
          choose what to calculate with all details.

          Type R, M, or H to draw the picture. To stop the
          drawing process, type S for Stop.

Rough     This is the standard chosen resolution. It calculates
          one hundreths of the points in the plane. Each coloured
          square on the screen represents 100 points in the
          highest resolution. It takes 100 times as long time to
          calculate the highest resolution where a calculation
          has to be done for each pixel on the screen. This
          resolution gives you a rough overview of the chosen
          part of the set.

          Type R to redraw the subset in rough resolution.

Medium    This resolution gives 10 times more detail than the
          Rough resolution. It is still 10 times faster than the
          High resolution. Sometimes, Rough is too rough, so use
          Medium resolution.

          Type M to draw the subset in medium resolution.

High      In High resolution a calculation is done for every
          pixel on the screen, giving the finest detail. It takes
          100 times as long time to calculate the picture as the
          Rough resolution. If you want to store picture, type S
          for Store. Then you don't have to wait for it being
          redrawn if you will see it again.

00h00m15s This field shows how long time has been spent drawing
          the picture. Note: it can take from seconds to hours.

Quit      When you want to leave the program, type Q for Quit.
          Nothing is lost because it is saved in a file on disk
          and the next time you start this program, you will
          enter where you left.

          Type Q to Quit.

>Larger   The foursquare shown in the generated picture shows
          what is going to be the next picture subset to draw
          when you type Z for Zoom. You can make the foursquare
          larger by typing > or smaller by type <.

          Type > to enlarge the foursquare.

<Smaller  Make the foursqare smaller.

          Type < to shrink the foursquare.

       You can move the foursquare around using the cursor
          keys.

Store     The picture you are seeing right now is stored in a
          file on disk if you type S. After having zoomed down on
          interesting details, you can go back typing D or U or a
          digit to see that picture again, reading it from disk
          without the time consuming process of recalculating it.

          Type S to store the picture.

Init      If you want to forget all you have done and all the
          pictures you have stored, type I for Init. The program
          is in the state it was the first time it was run. You
          can do the same thing by deleting the files MAN*.MAN
          and MAN*.PIC from your disk.

          Type I to start all over.

Picture:  This text labels the four fields below (Zoom, Down, Up,
          1 of 1). It has to do with showing pictures.

Zoom      Remember current settings for this picture and create a
          new picture which is the magnification of the picture
          shown in the foursquare. To see the previous picture,
          type U for Up.

          Type Z to zoom in.

Down      Show the next picture, i.e. go down to the zoomed area.

          Type D for the next picture.

Up        Show the previous picture, i.e. the picture where the
          of which the current one is part.

          Type U for the previously generated picture.

1 of 1    This field shows the number of the picture we are
          looking at, and it shows its number among the available
          number of pictures. You can type a digit, i.e. 1, 2, 3,
          etc. to see the picture with that number. If you have
          stored that picture with S for Store when it was
          generated, it loaded quickly from disk. Otherwise it
          will be recreated slowly again.

          Type 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 to see that picture.

Lim:40    As described elsewhere, a formula is iterated for the
          calculation of the colour of each pixel on the screen.
          The number of iterations is used to determin the colour
          of a pixel. For some areas of the picture, it might be
          necessary to iterate a large number of times before the
          formula reaches that certain value, perhaps infinitely
          many iterations. Therefore, a maximum limit on the
          number of iterations calculated is needed. Areas of the
          screen which exceed the maximum number of iterations is
          shown with the background colour. The limit has an
          initial value of 40. When you zoom in on small details
          you will have to increase this value, typing * or +.

          In order to help determining the Limit, you can type L
          to see the actual number of iterations needed for
          different areas of the picture. Areas, where the limit
          is exceeded, are shown as e.g. >40, meaning a larger
          number of iterations than 40. Hit any key to take the
          numbers away again.

          Type L to see actual number of iterations used for
          different parts of the screen, and hit any key to
          remove the numbers again.

*1.2 +1   Type * to increase the maximum number of iterations by
          20% and type + to increase it by one.

/1.2 -1   Type / to decrease the maximum number of iterations by
          20% and type - to decrease it by one.

Resol:    This field shows the size of a calculated pixel. It
          gives an idea of the magnification of the picture.
0.058

P         Shows which colours are used for this picture. Type P
          for Palette to select among the 4 other palettes.

C         Is the colour model used. Each iteration number is
          assigned a particular colour from the model. The
          colours for the first 63 iterations are shown on the
          colour bar.

          Type C for Colour model to choose another model among
          the 4 available models.

          Note: if the selected colouring model shall be
          effective, the picture must be redrawn.

The people at UniComal A/S wish you many happy and joyful hours.
